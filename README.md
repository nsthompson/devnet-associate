# Python Skill Checks for DevNet Associate Exam

## Skill Check #1

Create a program that asks the user for a number and then prints out a list of all the divisors of that number.
If you are unfamiliar with divisors, they are numbers that divide evenly into another number.
For example, 10 is a divisor of 100 because 100 / 10 has no remainder.

Your output should look similar to this:

```shell
Enter a natural number: 100
[1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20, 25, 50, 100]
```

## Skill Check #2

Ask the user for a string and print out whether this string is a palindrome or not.
(A palindrome is a string that reads the same forwards and backwards.)

## Skill Check #3

Make a two-player Rock-Paper-Scissors game.
Ask for player plays, compare them, print out a message of congratulations to the winner, and ask if the players want to start a new game.

Remember the rules:

* Rock beats scissors
* Scissors beats paper
* Paper beats rock
